The reason I decided to learn software engineering is probably very different from a lot of people's reason. Most people tell me that they are learning software engineering because they love to code or want a better career and to make more money. Perhaps they are working on making themselves more marketable in this technology driven world we live in and developing software engineering skill sets and experience seems to be an intelligent opportunity to invest in intellectually. 

While all these reasons are substantial reasons and I would be misleading if I said that in the background they aren't reasons that support my main priority and focus. Yet the main reason for me is that over 20 years ago I had a vision of a project that would support Christians internationally that would involve developing a program that would need coding skills.  For the first time I actually can see how the plan is coming together. Before this present time, I couldn't see it but I believed it and now I am engaged in the process of laying the foundation of my ministry with this process of learning software engineering. 

It's strange for me because I have always understood technology and found myself involved in projects that involved evolving technology but I was never on the other side of creating and developing programming. I am invigorated to be involved in this program and the opportunity to progress through this journey. I see how it is meant to be for me, such a time as the present time.
